I. Game Overview

    Executive Summary

This is a music composition game that is as entertaining as it is educational. It is an exercise in design that will showcase our creative limits and push what education means though the use of music and interactive media. The traditional way of learning how to read sheet music is through playing an instrument and learning through the Suzuki method. What if you could learn through playing a game, and transfer those skills into playing an instrument? Specifically: what if you could play a guitar hero style game using a real instrument, but not try and match a song, but to try and make new songs? The concept does not have to be limited to instruments, but can also extend to synthesizers and other non-traditional instruments as well.

    Core Player Activity

The players will be (TK)

    Creation and manipulation of music + usage of color and abstract shapes to represent said music.

    Creation by note association (scales), manipulation by non-standard scales.

    Play through an instrument/mouse/keyboard/touch screen/controller

    Multiplayer: Teacher/Student, competitive, co-op

    Look, Sound, and Feel

Looks: To be determined

Sound: Mix of real and synthesised instruments

Feel: To be determined

II. Rationale

    Research

Suzuki method- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_method

Solfège- used in ear training and theory: do re me fa sol la ti do

sight reading/singing and ear training

Chromatic theory- focus on chromatic scale: sharps/flats, half steps

Diatonic theory- focus on pitches within scales without accidentals

Diatonic ear training vs. atonal ear training

Circle of fifths - which teaches students about key signatures

MacGamut- do more research

    Importance

Different teaching methods yield different results. Depending on what method we use to teach our players, we’ll have varying results on varying topics. We need to try to find a method that balances all of the different approaches to learning music theory in order to have the most balanced approach and teach most effectively.

    Differentiation

Different learning modes- specialized in Solfège, or music theory prepared ahead of time, instant gratification vs prepared and then played.

Learning music is difficult under normal circumstances, no need to make it more difficult with only one method that may or may not work as efficiently for everyone. Choice is a must.

III. Contextual Gameplay

   

    Game Mechanics

1) Platformer

    Think a platformer along the lines of the Rayman games, but with a little Sound Shapes in there. The goal of the game is to create the music for that level. As the player progresses, beyond the simple goal of making it from one end to the other, they must also hit the notes on the sheet music background of the level. With a foreground composed entirely of the art and original characters created for the game.

2) Music School

    The concept here is a step away from the platformer idea that is a much better teaching tool. As opposed to having players move through the levels in order to “collect” the notes and progress, they would instead be presented with the job of placing the notes in the proper spots. Different inputs or hotkeys could represent different notes, in order to allow for the whole note/half note/quarter note, etc.

3) Compose mode-

    The main thought behind this mode is the creation of music by the players. Instead of having ghost notes that the players fill in, they are the ones creating the music and writing the sheet music.

        Name of Primary Mechanic

Talk about the different game mechanics in detail here. Do not be afraid to go on too long. You must be as precise as possible, describing every moment of the action: what role the player has in the mechanic, how it starts, how it stops, what effect it has on the player etc

        Other Mechanics

There are, of course, times where mechanics are nested. Where a larger mechanic has smaller, more specific, instances. An example of this is ‘items’ that the player can use. Simply describe that the player can use ‘items’…

                Name of Specific Item: …then explain the effect of each one.

                Name of Another Item: Describe another ‘item’. Perhaps how it relates to the one above.

    Shell Functions

Adding new sound libraries if possible?

Leaderboards

Multiplayer is on backburner. may or may not be possible

Standard pick something menu

Pause menus- options and etc (fermata)

Metronome (Speed up/down feature)

Bars for your scale would glow and indicator for sharps/flats

Sound options, SFX on or off, music levels, etc.

Scale Swap- teaching circle of fifths

Exporting sheet music?

    Game Flow

This will be in diagram form and is usually found in an appendix, which will be listed here.

    Game Controls

Mouse Keyboard, gamepad?

IV. Visual

A.    Main Game View

B.    In-Game GUI

            Ghost Notes: These are the notes that the player will see on the sheet music (the set), as well as the notes that the player can place (the possible). They are literally notes on the sheet itself, with grey ones that are not filled in as the set and colored ones as the possible.

            Song Name/Composer: Song name and the composer or arranger will be towards the top left of the screen, or top center to stay true to real sheet music.

            Time: Either top left or top right corner to track how much time has passed since starting the song.

            BPM/Tempo: Near the

            Key/Scale/Accidentals: Highlighted on the bar scale

            Note selection: Bottom of the screen. Shows what notes are available on the key you have chosen. Color coordinated with the ghost notes. 

C.    Schematics

This section contains rough visual examples of some the game’s actions and screens.

V. Sound

A.    Music/Score

This is where you want to describe the different kinds of music that will appear in your game. Be as general or as specific as you like, giving an overall feel for the musical style, or going into individual pieces.

            Name of Individual Piece

Talk about how the piece of music should make the player feel. Describe whether it’s connected to an area, story sequence, character, etc.

B.    Sound Effects

Kept to a minimum during game play, but effects are on while in menus.

Do not underestimate the importance of this section. People’s hearing is typically much more sensitive than their sight, they will hear something before they register it visually. Describe the different varieties of sound effects that you will have in your game; player actions, cursor selection, etc.

            Name of Sound Effect (Typically the corresponding action)

Describe the action that cues the sound effect. It’s best to give an example such as ‘nails on a chalkboard’, or ‘plucked violin string’. Be specific about which part of the action produces the sound; is there a delay? For actions that have multiple sound effects, list and describe them generally.

                Name of Specific Sound Effect: …then go into more detail about each of them specifically


VI.    Game Elements

A.    Characters

Describe the different types of characters that the player will encounter in the game here. Give a feel for the overall relationships the player will encounter with friends, allies, enemies, etc.

            Name/Type of Character

This can be as detailed as it needs to be. Talk about what the character looks like, what he/she can do, his/her relationship to the other characters. You should give a feeling for what the character is like to either manipulate or interact with.

B.    Levels

Like you did with the characters, give a feeling of what the world is like. If there are different, distinct areas in the game, then give a quick list and description of them.

            Name of Mission

Describe the arc of the mission. How the player will receive it, how they will go about fulfilling the mission, and finally, how it can be completed. Give some kind of impression of the scope of the mission. Is it a brief side-quest, a hurdle the player must pass to progress, or something that the player works on for the entire game?

            Name of Area/Level

This is more general than the description of a mission. Similar to a character, you want to give an impression of what it is like to explore the area/mission. What is the history of the area? What kind of characters will the player encounter? Why is the player there, and how do they enter or exit the area/level? Most importantly, what does it look like? Additionally, talk about what kind of missions will challenge the player while they are there.

C.    Objects

List and briefly describe the kinds of ‘things’ that the player will encounter/collect/use during the game. These could be items that the player buys or finds, or one that they use just once and never use again.

            Name of Object(s)

What does the item look like? Where does the player first encounter the object? What does the player do with it? Give an impression of what it’s like to use the item. Explain the connections it has to characters and/or places. Is it a singular item, or is there a collection of similar items?

                Name of Specific Item: If the item is part of a collection of similar items, then give a description of each one specifically.

D.    Copy/Cut-scenes

Talk generally about the different ways that the narrative, setting or context of the game will be communicated to the player. This could be through animated cut-scenes, exchanges between characters using dialogue boxes, or simply a screen/pop-up of text.

            Name of Instance (‘Intro’, ‘The Truth is Revealed’, etc.)

A brief summarization of what is going to be related. You can go in to as much detail as you need. There is probably going to be a separate script, so you don’t need to give a blow-by-blow account of what is going to transpire.

            Name of Another Instance

Give a sense of progression from one instance to another. This is important whether you’re describing a story told through cut-scenes or the rules/goals of the next part of the game.

Notes:

    Tutorial ideas- scales place as you go, up and down, in ¼ notes, as you progress through levels you gain more for your repertoire- you gain ⅛ notes and such.

    Think of ways to place notes below and higher than the bar staff.
